# WatchGuard Firebox Add-on for Splunk

The WatchGuard Firebox Add-on for Splunk enables Splunk to collect and parse data from
WatchGuard firebox security appliances. This app normalizes Firebox logs into CIM-compliant
datamodels for use with Splunk Enterprise Security and other Splunk Enterprise apps. You can
also consume this data using the separate WatchGuard Visibility App for Splunk.
